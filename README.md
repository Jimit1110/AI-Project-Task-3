This Repository Contains a Notebook in which I have implemented various Text Generation and Text2Text generation models.

Notebook Details:

1) In task3(T5-small) implementation of T5-small models is there.

2) In Task3(Bart,_Flan_T5_base,phi_2) implementation of Bart, Flan-T5, and phi-2 is there.

3) In Task3(rebel_large,LaMini_all) implementation of rebel_large and various LaMini's model is there.

conclusion:

For research book name generation MBZUAI/LaMini-Flan-T5-783M model is working perfectly and for fact enhancement MBZUAI/LaMini-Flan-T5-783M and MBZUAI/LaMini-GPT-774M is good.
